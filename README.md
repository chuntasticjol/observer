The Observer is a software for a face recognition and face tracking.
The application should be able to fully and reliably control the movement of the camera using two 180Â° servomotors in a half-space. For the recognition the HaarCascades from official OpenCV GitHub repo are used. All variables are configurable (for more information, run the application with the `--help` flag).

The other part of this project is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1of6aFjSCA9LWL8vPtI93ILUU1oUt7Fva?usp=sharing.

## Dependencies

The observer uses these dependencies to run properly:
  * Go v1.14 (https://golang.org/dl/)
  * Gobot v1.14.0 (https://gobot.io/)
  * GoCV v0.23.0 with OpenCV v4.3.0 (https://gocv.io/)
  * HaarCascade (https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
  
## Installation

On Raspberry Pi (CPU ARMv6+), with `go`, `opencv4`, `gocv` and `gobot` installed, run this command to install executable file into your PATH:

```bash
$ go get github.com/chutified/observer-rpi
```

Or you can also get `install.sh` file and run it in the project folder to install all dependencies and the Observer software (can take up to 15 minutes, depends on the performance):

```bash
$ ./install
```

Type `./observer -h` for the help.

*(tested on Raspbian OS with Raspberry Pi 3B+)*
