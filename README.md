Observer is a software for a face recognition and face tracking. This software is a part of a six-month school project.

The application should be able to fully and reliably control the movement of the camera using two 180Â° servomotors in a half-space. For the recognition it uses the HaarCascades that are located in the `data` directory. All variables are changeable (for more information, run the application with the `--help` flag).

The final work is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1of6aFjSCA9LWL8vPtI93ILUU1oUt7Fva?usp=sharing.

## Dependencies

The observer uses these to run properly:
  * Go v1.14 (https://golang.org/dl/)
  * Gobot v1.14.0 (https://gobot.io/)
  * GoCV v0.23.0 with OpenCV v4.3.0 (https://gocv.io/)
  * HaarCascade (https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
  
## Instalation

On Raspberry Pi (CPU ARMv6+) with `go` and `opencv4` installed run:

```bash
$ go get github.com/chutified/observer
```

And then type `./observer -h` for the help.

*(tested on Raspbian OS with Raspberry Pi 3B+)*
