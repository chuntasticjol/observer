## About

The Observer is a software for a face recognition and face tracking devices. The
application is able to fully and reliably control the movement of the camera
using two servomotors in any direction. The real-time recognition algorithm is
provided by the optimized computer vision library OpenCV.

The entire software was developed with a performance in mind and all decisions
were made to be perfectly compatible with low-end PCs (aiming to be runnable on
minicomputers like Raspberry Pis).
