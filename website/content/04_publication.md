## Publication

The document which explains the goals of the Observer project. Everything
including the original inspiration and motive is thoroughly described and
discussed. All the questions/answers and critical decisions that were made
during the development process are included and analyzed as well.

The document also communicates my personal struggles, mistakes and doubts caused
by lack of knowledge, poor design choices and low budget for hardware
components. However, all obstacles and inaccuracies had been overcome and the
project was successfully finished.
